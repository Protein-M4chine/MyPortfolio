                     I am from the Chattanooga, TN area, and I have a background in Customer Service, Desktop Support, and Military Experience (ARNG). While nearing the end of completing my BS in IT at East Tennessee State University (in Johnson City, TN), I really gained an appreciation for the ASP.NET Core web development framework.

                    While I have also had some experience with the WAMP stack and PHP, I have personally found the most success with the ASP.NET framework and C#. In particular, I enjoy working on the back-end of web applications, dealing with pipelines, routing, and database connections. I am also familiar with the Agile Methodology, and I actively worked in weekly scrum meetings in my Software Development courses.

                    In my spare time, I like to do active things like working out, camping, and playing basketball. I also play drums, and chess. I am big on constant self-improvement and self-learning, and my work ethic is to see a job through until completion, even if it requires that you be the last person remaining at work for that day.

                <p>
                    I am currently developing this social media application. It's just like Facebook and Twitter, just without all the deranking and deplatforming of users and content that they don't agree with. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platform also focuses on User Privacy (no constant collection, analyzation, and selling of user data). There is also a focus on User Privacy, and simplicity of design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This web application is currently being built on ASP.NET Core Razor Pages.

                <p>
                    The BucBoard is a centralized hub where professors can notify students of important announcements, and where students can schedule office meetings with those professors.
                    This application features two main parts: (1) Touch screen functionality for professors to run this application on touch screens right outside there office for students to interact with
                    and (2) Remote access for the professor which allows the professor to log into an online portal and update the announcements log.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This web application was developed in my Software Engineering 2 class by my team (Dreamteam 2.1 Beta) which consisted of myself, Austin Funderburke (Scrum Master),
                    Charles Walker (Database Administrator/Back-end Developer), Chase Day (Project Owner/Front and Back-end Developer), Dan Slover (Metrics Analyst), and Tanner Smith
                    (Front-end Developer/Presentation Organizer). I focused mainly on the back-end CRUD aspects of this application, particularly the announcement and schedule functions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The framework utilized for this project was ASP.NET Core MVC
                </p>
                <p>The following image shows the main page which will display on the touch screens outside professors' offices.</p>

                <p>
                    This is an academic project that I developed for my Advanced Web Development course my last semester at University. I created this web application with Microsoft's ASP.NET framework using MVC with Identity Account Authorization.
                <p>
                    It features an online supermarket where shoppers can buy grocery items with full shopping cart functionality. There are two types of accounts: admin, or standard user. Admins can sells items (they have CRUD permissions
                    for the items) while standard users can purchase items through the shopping cart checkout.
                </p>
                <p>The following image shows a typical shopping cart view that a standard user would see while viewing their shopping cart.</p>
